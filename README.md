A compendium of useful/interesting/inspirational usage of pandas functions, each example will be an ipynb file


## What is this repository?

This repository aims to store these impressive solutions in pandas and the associated examples. Each real-world task will be presented as a jupyter files to make it easy to follow step by step.
